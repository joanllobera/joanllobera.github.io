Two of the main emerging topics in the videogame industry is the practical use of machine learning to develop games, and the increasing adoption of Virtual Reality as a gaming platform. I was given the chance to design the curriculum of an  optional course in the 4th year of the degree in videogame development, and this is what I came up with.
