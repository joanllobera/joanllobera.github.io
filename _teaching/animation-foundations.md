## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Topics addressed

3D Character animation is a tricky business. It involves complicated mathematics, handcrafted efforts, and a plethora of techniques. You can find here all the materials used to teach a course lasting 15-16 weeks, with 4 hours or class per week. It covers the following topics:
 * 3D Rotations (particularly using Quaternions and Axis Angle representations)
 * Direct and Inverse Kinematics (Gradient Descent, CCD, Fabrik)
 * Animations in a game engine (From Motion Builder to Unity3D)
 * Physics for animation in games
  There is also a fair amount of emphasis on practical aspects of programming, like:
 * Git, and particularly Git Flow (branches, releases, tags, etc.)
 * Improving the work habits, and documentation. This includes naming conventions, functionality encapsulation, and use of assembly libraries


### 1.2 Syllabus and Deliveries

 The course is organized in four blocks:
 1. 3D Rotations
 2. GIT and programming habits
 3. Direct and Inverse Kinematics
 4. Animation 
 
 It is organized in three deliveries:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 
 
 
 
 
###  1.2 Requirements
Despite they are re-introduced during the course, a student of this course would, ideally, have a decent understanding of the following topics:

**Mathematics:**
* Trigonometry, Dot and Cross product
* Basic notions of calculus (derivation and integration). 
* Physical simulations (Euler Step).

**Programming:** 
* Understand the basic class structure of Unity3D (Monobehaviour, Component)
* Acquaintance with the syntax of C# and use of the Unity3D API
* Use of git

If you want to follow this course but feel like you have gaps on these topics, you can follow the materials introduced here, since each of these topics are introduced briefly. However, you might need to find alternative sources to explore them more exhaustively for a full understanding of the aspects covered here.

### 1.3 Credits

The materials here introduced have been used in a course delivered at the third year of a four year degree for computer scientists specialized in videogame development. The materials have been used during scholar years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 at ENTI-UB ( [Escola de Noves Tecnologies Interactives](www.enti.cat) of [Universitat de Barcelona](www.ub.edu)).

The course has been organized using a miscelanea of materials, both adapting topics and exercises from academic-oriented books and from tutorials available online. I have tried to credit all the sources used, but please let me know if some material does not credit properly the original source.
