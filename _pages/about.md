For the last 15 years, my main job interest has been to try to help VR work. This medium might change the world, for the better of worse. My everyday activities involve:

* Academic Research, combining mainly software engineering  and behavioural experiments, with insights from cognitive sciences. A reasonable list of papers can be found on [Google Scholar] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JOml1uEAAAAJ&hl=en)

* I take care of several undergraduate courses related with, mainly, computer graphics and technical aspects of character animation. You can find many of the materials used in section  [Courses] (/teaching/) 

* I also develop VR production projects upon request
