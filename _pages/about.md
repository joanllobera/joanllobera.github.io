I am a Virtual Reality scientist. My research combines software engineering and behavioural experiments. Recently I have been working on bringing Physics-based Character Animation. A list of papers can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JOml1uEAAAAJ&hl=en).




 * [My PhD thesis(2006-2012)](/files/lloberaPhD2012.pdf) was supervised by [Mel Slater](http://www.melslater.me/)  and explored embodiment, social interaction and the creation of Virtual Reality stories based on interactive characters. 

 * [My Master thesis (2003)](files/memoire.pdf) was supervised by [Daniel Pressnitzer](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en/member/661/daniel-pressnitzer) and explored the neural basis of auditory perception using psychoacoustics and magnetoencephalography.


### Courses

Between 2017 and 2020 I created and taught different undergraduate and graduate courses at [ENTI](https://enti.cat/), a university school associated to the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/).   You can find the materials for:


* A second year introduction to computer graphics [here](/teaching/computer-graphics/) 

* A third year introduction to the algorithms of character animation [here](teaching/animation-foundations/)

In 2021 I taught a course on physics-based character animation at SIGGRAPH, the materials can be found [here](/physics-based/)


### Open Software projects

I have contributed to two significant software projects in the past.

* An implementation of Behaviour Networks for Unity3D can be found [here](TODO)
* A framework to create Physics-based Interactive Characters in Unity3D can be found [here](TODO)


### Startups

I have created two companies. 
* I founded [Timepath](TODO) (2014-2018) as an attempt to  materialize my vision of VR experiences based on embodied social interactive characters created through role-playing. 

* I co-founded [IZI Record](http://izirecord.com/) (2020 - present) to materialize an idea to transform video creation into a social activity through a software service that would  support live music and live musicians.  


### Hobbies

In my free time I like [making music](https://joanllobera.bandcamp.com) and [writing](TODO). When I had more free time I also explored [shooting short movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1vnQN5SCyc) and writing [movie scripts](/files/Despues-de-Alba.pdf)


In 2011 I participated in the creation of an [interactive art installation](files/ombresdellum.html)

In 2020 I directed the creation of a videogame for mobile phones by a group of last year students at [ENTI](https://enti.cat/)
