My name is Joan Llobera. Here you can find resources on my work and my hobbies.


### Research

I am a Virtual Reality scientist. My research combines software engineering and behavioural experiments. Recently I have been working on bringing Physics-based Character Animation to Virtual Reality. A list of papers can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JOml1uEAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.



### Courses

Between 2017 and 2020 I created and taught different undergraduate and graduate courses at [ENTI](https://enti.cat/){:target="_blank"}, a university school associated to the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/){:target="_blank"}.   You can find the materials for:


* A second year introduction to computer graphics [here](/teaching/computer-graphics.html){:target="_blank"} 

* A third year introduction to the algorithms of character animation [here](/teaching/animation-foundations.html){:target="_blank"}

In 2021 I taught a course on physics-based character animation at SIGGRAPH, the materials can be found [here](/teaching/physics-based.html){:target="_blank"}



### Thesis

 *  <a href="./files/lloberaPhD2012.pdf" target="_blank" title="PhD">My PhD thesis(2006-2012) </a>  was supervised by [Mel Slater](http://www.melslater.me/)  and explored embodiment, social interaction and the creation of Virtual Reality stories based on interactive characters. 

 
*  <a href="./files/memoire.pdf" target="_blank" title="MSc"> My MSc thesis (2003) </a>
 was supervised by [Daniel Pressnitzer](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en/member/661/daniel-pressnitzer) and explored the neural basis of auditory perception using psychoacoustics and magnetoencephalography.


### Open Software projects

I have contributed to two significant software projects in the past.



* A framework to create Physics-based Interactive Characters in Unity3D. A first version in Physx called [Marathon Environments](https://joanllobera.github.io/marathon-envs){:target="_blank"}. Later, it  was succeded by [Modular Agents](https://github.com/Balint-H/modular-agents){:target="_blank"}  a more mature framework based on MuJoCo, developed with Balint Hodossy.

* An implementation of Behaviour Networks for Unity3D *to be published when I have the time*.

### Startups

I have created two companies. 
* I founded [Timepath](/timepath-archive){:target="_blank"} (2014-2018) as an attempt to  materialize my vision of VR experiences based on embodied social interactive characters created through role-playing. 

* I co-founded [IZI Record](http://izirecord.com/){:target="_blank"} (2020 - 2025) to transform mobile video creation into a social activity, with a focus on people attending and recording live music concerts ([here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9NgqHyV61ZaTcjZ2270WLvHeVXEVIZ_e&si=o_vHSEmQDLB31Pd4){:target="_blank"} are some examples of videos). 


### Hobbies

When I have free time I like [making music](https://joanllobera.bandcamp.com){:target="_blank"} and writing short stories (*examples coming soon*). When I had more free time I also explored [shooting short movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1vnQN5SCyc){:target="_blank"} and writing [movie scripts](/files/Despues-de-Alba.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  Occasionally I also spend time doing photos.

In 2011 I participated in the creation of an [interactive art installation](files/ombresdellum/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

In 2020 I directed a [videogame prototype](https://joanllobera.github.io/sonthegame/){:target="_blank"} that worked in mobile phones and VR headsets. It was implemented by a group of last year students at [ENTI](https://enti.cat/){:target="_blank"}.
